  of all the files which are contained in the Shoola CVS module and which are 
  listed in each 'Artifacts' entry within the 'Third-Party Software Licenses'

  shall refer to any other file contained in the Shoola CVS module.
  
  
  
  Purpose
  -------
  
  This document states which licenses apply to which files in the Shoola CVS

  Third-Party Software Licenses
  -----------------------------
  
  We are in debt with many open-source projects for providing us with valuable
  artifacts, ranging from application libraries to graphics files.  This section
  lists all the third-party software that is used by Shoola.  Software artifacts
  are grouped according to the project of provenience and using the following 
  format:
  
  Project: The name of the project the artifacts belong to and a brief 
  		(optional) description.
  Web Site: The project's Web site address.
  Artifacts: The files our software makes use of.  The wildcard character * can
  		be appended to a sequence of characters S denoting a file name.  
  		This shall mean 'all the files whose name starts with S'.  For example, 
  		'ant-*' means all the files whose name starts with 'ant-'.
  		Unless otherwise specified, directory pathnames are given relative to 
  		the root of the Shoola SVN module.
  License: The type of license that applies to the files listed in 'Artifacts'.

                                    Legal





  Preamble
  --------

  Within this document, the term 'third-party software' shall refer to the set
  of all the files which are contained in the source repository and which are
  listed in each 'Artifacts' entry within the 'Third-Party Software Licenses'
  section of this document. The term 'OME' or, equivalently, 'our software'
  shall refer to any other file contained in the repository.



  Purpose
  -------

  This document states which licenses apply to which files in the
  source repository. It also gives credit to other projects and
  developers that provided us with their valuable software.



  OMERO.server License
  ---------------------

  Our software is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License
  (GPL), a copy of which may be found in the 'gpl.txt' file within this
  directory.



  Third-Party Software Licenses
  -----------------------------

  We are in debt with many open-source projects for providing us with
  valuable artifacts, ranging from application libraries to graphics
  files. This section lists all the third-party software that is used
  by OMERO.server using the following format:

  Artifacts:    The files our software makes use of. The wildcard character * can
                be appended to a sequence of characters S denoting a file name.
                This shall mean 'all the files whose name starts with S'. For example,
                'ant-*' means all the files whose name starts with 'ant-'.
                Unless otherwise specified, all artifacts are to be found under
                lib/repository. If specified directory pathnames are given relative to
                the root of the git repository.
  Project:      The name of the project the artifacts belong to and a brief
                (optional) description.
  Web Site:     The project's Web site address.
  License:      The type of license that applies to the files listed in 'Artifacts'.
  License File: The file, within this directory, that contains the license.

                interfaces that are defined by external standards organizations. For DOM, 
                that's the W3C.

## Templates and guidelines for copyright and license headers
## which should be included in ALL files within this repository
## except where specified below.
##
## General guidelines:
## -------------------
##
## * The "(C)" is preferred but optional, and need not
##   be added to files missing it, but in general should be
##
## * Shorter copyright lines (80 or less) can have the
##   "All rights reserved." on the "Copyright" line. E.g.,
##
##     Copyright 2011 Glencoe Software, Inc. All rights reserved.
##
##   in which case there doesn't have to be a blank line
##   before the license block.
##
## * When a file is modified in a year not covered in the
##   copyright, the year range should be updated to reflect
##   the new year. The copyright itself should not be
##   changed. For example, "2008-2010" in a file modified
##   in 2011 should become "2008-2011", and no other changes
##   should be made to the header.
##
## * Where present, the fully qualified class or "$Id$" field
##   can be left, but omitting them is the preferred style.
##
## * The patterns below are checked via checkstyle patterns
##   defined in docs/styles/headers.xml
##
## * For non-licensed files (XSL, XSD), the license block
##   can be omitted.

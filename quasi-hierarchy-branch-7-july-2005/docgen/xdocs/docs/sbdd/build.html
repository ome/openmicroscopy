<p>The build process is designed to be cross-platform and self-contained. What all 
  this means is that you can run the various build tasks (which we'll refer to as 
  <i>targets</i> in the remainder of this document) on any machine where a Java Development 
  Kit (JDK version 1.4 or later) is available, without having to worry about resolving 
  library dependencies. In fact, all the libraries required by the application and 
  test code as well as those needed for the build itself come in the CVS module and 
  are automatically linked as needed.</p>
<p>A convenience tool is povided to run any of the available build targets. However, 
  you can run the build with <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> if you prefer 
  -- in this case some configuration is required, as detailed in a later section. 
  The remainder of this section details the various build targets and provides useful 
  information related to the build process.</p>

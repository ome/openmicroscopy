<body bgcolor="white">

Provides web components for OMERO services. The control flow is as follows:

<ol>
 <li>Requent is delivered to Spring's Dispatcher Servlet (see web.xml)</li>
 <li>DispatcherServlet uses Spring configuration to find the matching controller</li>
 <li>The controller uses services available in the Spring ApplicationContext,</li>
 <li>which use DAOs also in the context to access the Database</li>
 <li>Values to be returned are stored in a model and returned to a View with a implementation-independent name,</li>
 <li>which renders the values and returns them in the HTTP response</li>
</ol>

<p>Important to note is that many technologies play a role in each of these steps. For example in the view step, Tiles (http://TODO) inserts various pieces of the response from its own controller</p>

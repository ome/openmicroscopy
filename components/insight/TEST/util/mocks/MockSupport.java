/** 
 * Provides mocks with the means to easily implement the life-cycle required
 * by the {@link IMock} interface.
 * <p>A mock object makes a new a <code>MockSupport</code> and links it to
 * itself at creation time.  The mock object is now in expectations set up mode
 * (as required by the life-cycle contract) and so is its
 * <code>MockSupport</code>.  All the mock object has to do is to collect
 * expectations in the form of {@link MockedCall}'s and append them to the
 * <code>MockSupport</code>'s list (calling {@link #add(MockedCall)}), in the
 * same order as they were collected.  This is important as the order in which
 * expectations are appended to the list is also the order in which calls will
 * be verified.</p>
 * <p>When the {@link IMock#activate() activate} method is called on the mock
 * object, it simply has to forward this call to its <code>MockSupport</code>,
 * which transitions to verification mode.  Now it's not possible to collect
 * expectations any more and the {@link #add(MockedCall) add} method will throw
 * an exception if an attempt is made &#151; this means the mock object won't
 * have to keep track of the state, its <code>MockSupport</code> already does
 * that.</p>
 * <p>At this point the mock object is in verification mode (as required by the
 * life-cycle contract) and so is its <code>MockSupport</code>.  Upon
 * invocation, each mocked method within the mock object will first create a
 * {@link MockedCall} to reflect the current invocation, then pass this new
 * object to the {@link #verifyCall(MockedCall) verifyCall} method, and finally
 * get back the original {@link MockedCall} that was expected &#151; this is
 * done so that the method may extract the return value, if any, from the
 * original expected call (the one set by means of {@link #add(MockedCall)})
 * and return it.  If the {@link MockedCall} object passed to 
 * {@link #verifyCall(MockedCall) verifyCall} doesn't match the current call
 * expectation (as set in the original sequence), the test fails.</p>
 * <p>The {@link #verifyCallSequence() verifyCallSequence} method is meant to
 * be invoked at the end of the test to verify that all expected calls were
 * performed.  If less calls were performed, then the test fails.  So all the
 * mock object has to do is to call this method when its 
 * {@link IMock#verify() verify} method is invoked.</p>

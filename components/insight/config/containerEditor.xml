 *                     OMERO.insight MASTER CONFIGURATION FILE
 *
 * This file specifies the configuration settings for the OMERO.insight runtime 
 * (the Container) and links the available UI components (the Agents) to it. The
 * configuration entries are organized in the following groups:
 *
 * + Services: The runtime services provided by the Container.
 * + Agents: The UI components that will be loaded at runtime.
 * + Resources: Icons and fonts used by the widgets that are part of the 
 *              Container.
 * + Look and Feel: The L&F to use for the whole application.
 *
 *
 * Note that the only entry that needs to be edited *before* launching 
 * OMERO.insight is the URL of the OMERO Data Server (OMERODS) in the Services 
 * group. All other entries can optionally be edited to tweak runtime behavior, 
 * but can in most cases be safely ignored.

          rendering settings.  Because the Rendering Engine can only process
          one image at a time, the value you specify here will equal the 
          maximum amount of memory that will be used for caching rendered
          images at any given time.  If set to 0 or a negative value, then
          no caching will be done (this dramatically reduces responsiveness

         be requested after the current plane.  If 0 or negative, then no
         asynchronous rendering will take place.
         Having asynchronous rendering on usually increses performance and
         responsiveness.  However, take into account that too a high value
         can be counterproductive (what is "high" depends on your platform

  Open Microscopy Environment - Install Notes (Java Client)
  ---------------------------------------------------------


  Preamble
  ________

  The client software requires a J2SE Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to
  run (version 1.6 or higher).
  If you don't have one already, you can download the J2SE JRE install bundle
  from:

    http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html


  NOTE
  You don't need to download the whole J2SE SDK, just the JRE is enough.

  Install Procedure
  _________________

  Extract the downloaded bundle in any directory on your local file system,
  and check that the startup scripts are executable:
    OMEROinsight_unix.sh
    OMEROimporter_unix.sh

  If you are connecting to the internet through a web proxy, make sure you edit
  the startup scripts accordingly (example configuration is provided within
  the scripts).

  Running The Software
  ____________________

  Run the script from a terminal:
  $ ./OMEROinsight_unix.sh

  You can also symlink these scripts into a location on your PATH. Some linux
  distributions will allow you to run these scripts by double clicking them in
  a file browser.

  Enter your OMERO user name, password and the name of the server then press
  the log in button.
  You should not have to modify the port value.
  Enjoy OMERO!

  You can also run the importer as a standalone application by running
  OMEROimporter_unix.sh.

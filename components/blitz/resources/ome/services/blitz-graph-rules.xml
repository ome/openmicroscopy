    Key for rule specifications:

        In square brackets, what action to take on the object:
            E = exclude: do not operate on, unlink from target objects
            I = include: operate on
            D = delete
            O = outside: do not operate on, do not even unlink from target objects
        In matches, starting these action letters with a ! negates the given set.
        For changes, in the square brackets an additional action is available:
            - = process: apply rule set to the object and its relationships

        In curly braces, the orphan status of the object:
            i = irrelevant: don't care about orphan status
            r = relevant: care about orphan status but don't know it
            o = orphan: it is an orphan
            a = attached: it is not an orphan
        This may be present alongside [E] only. Orphan status is processed for excluded objects only.
        In matches, starting these orphan status letters with a ! negates the given set.

        After a forward slash for matches, the permissions required for the object by the user:
            u = may be updated
            d = may be deleted
            m = may be moved
            g = may be given
            o = owns
        In matches, starting these permissions letters with a ! negates the given set.

        After a forward slash for changes, the permissions checked:
            n = none, propagates to subsequent related changes

        For the equals signs:
            == is not nullable
            =? is nullable
            =  is either of the above
        A /o suffix means that the two objects must have the same owner.

        Following $ is the name of a condition that may or may not be set by the request.

    Rules are executed in the order in which they are listed. However, if depending on order, note that rules
    based on multiple relationships cannot match when the common linking object is not the object being processed.

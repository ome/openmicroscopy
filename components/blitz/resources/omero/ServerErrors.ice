/**
 * Exceptions thrown by OMERO server components. Exceptions thrown client side
 * are available defined in each language binding separately, but will usually
 * subclass from "ClientError" For more information, see:
 *
 *   <a href="http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/omero/wiki/ExceptionHandling">
 *      http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/omero/wiki/ExceptionHandling
 *   </a>
 *
 * including examples of what a appropriate try/catch block would look like.
 *
 * <p>
 * All exceptions that are thrown by a remote call (any call on a *Prx instance)
 * will be either a subclass of [Ice::UserException] or [Ice::LocalException].
 * <a href="http://zeroc.com/doc/Ice-3.3.1/manual/Slice.5.10.html#50592"> Figure 4.4 </a>
 * from the Ice manual shows the entire exception hierarchy. The exceptions described in
 * this file will subclass from [Ice::UserException]. Other Ice-runtime exceptions subclass
 * from [Ice::LocalException].
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *
 * OMERO Specific:
 * ===============
 *  ServerError (root server exception)
 *   |
 *   |_ InternalException (server bug)
 *   |
 *   |_ ResourceError (non-recoverable)
 *   |
 *   |_ ConcurrencyException (recoverable)
 *   |  |_ ConcurrentModification (data was changed)
 *   |  |_ OptimisticLockException (changed data conflicts)
 *   |  |_ LockTimeout (took too long to aquire lock)
 *   |  |_ TryAgain (some processing required before server is ready)
 *   |  \_ TooManyUsersException
 *   |     \_ DatabaseBusyException
 *   |
 *   |_ ApiUsageException (misuse of services)
 *   |   |_ OverUsageException (too much)
 *   |   |_ QueryException (bad query string)
 *   |   \_ ValidationException (bad data)
 *   |
 *   |_ SecurityViolation (some no-no)
 *   |   \_ GroupSecurityViolation
 *   |      |_ PermissionMismatchGroupSecurityViolation
 *   |      \_ ReadOnlyGroupSecurityViolation
 *   |
 *   \_SessionException
 *      |_ RemovedSessionException (accessing a non-extant session)
 *      |_ SessionTimeoutException (session timed out; not yet removed)
 *      \_ ShutdownInProgress      (session on this server will most likely be destroyed)
 * </pre>
 *
 *
 * <p>
 * However, in addition to [Ice::LocalException] subclasses, the Ice runtime also
 * defines subclasses of [Ice::UserException]. In some cases, OMERO subclasses
 * from these exceptions. The subclasses shown below are not exhaustive, but show those
 * which an application's exception handler may want to deal with.
 * </p>
 *
 *
 * <pre>
 *  Ice::Exception (root of all Ice exceptions)
 *   |
 *   |_ Ice::UserException (super class of all application exceptions)
 *   |  |
 *   |  |_ Glacier2::CannotCreateSessionException (1 of 2 exceptions throwable by createSession)
 *   |  |   |_ omero::AuthenticationException (bad login)
 *   |  |   |_ omero::ExpiredCredentialException (old password)
 *   |  |   |_ omero::WrappedCreateSessionException (any other server error during createSession)
 *   |  |   \_ omero::licenses::NoAvailableLicensesException (see tools/licenses/resources/omero/LicensesAPI.ice)
 *   |  |
 *   |  \_ Glacier2::PermissionDeniedException (other of 2 exceptions throwable by createSession)
 *   |
 *   \_ Ice::LocalException (should generally be considered fatal. See exceptions below)
 *       |
 *       |_ Ice::ProtocolException (something went wrong on the wire. Wrong version?)
 *       |
 *       |_ Ice::RequestFailedException
 *       |   |_ ObjectNotExistException (Service timeout or similar?)
 *       |   \_ OperationNotExistException (Improper use of uncheckedCast?)
 *       |
 *       |_ Ice::UknownException (server threw an unexpected exception. Bug!)
 *       |
 *       \_ Ice::TimeoutException
 *           \_ Ice::ConnectTimeoutException (Couldn't establish a connection. Retry?)
 *
 * </pre>

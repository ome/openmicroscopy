/**
 *
 * Callback servant used to wait until a HandlePrx would
 * return non-null on getReponse. The server will notify
 * of completion to prevent constantly polling on
 * getResponse. Subclasses can override methods for handling
 * based on the completion status.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>
 *      cb = new CmdCallbackI(client, handle);
 *      response = null;
 *      while (response == null) {
 *          response = cb.block(500);
 *      }
 *
 *      // or
 *
 *      response = cb.loop(5, 500);
 * </pre>
 *
 * Subclasses which depend on the proper ordering of either initialization
 * or calls to {@link #onFinished(Response, Status, Current)} should make
 * use of the {@link #initializationDone()} and {@link #waitOnInitialization()},
 * or the {@link #onFinishedDone()} and {@link #waitOnFinishedDone()} methods.

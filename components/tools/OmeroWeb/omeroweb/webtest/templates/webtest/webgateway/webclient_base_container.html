        This page extends "webclient/base/base_container.html" and makes the following changes:
        <ul>
            <li>Adds page Title</li>
            <li>Adds this text to the 'content' block and text headers to the left and right panels</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h1>Login Required</h1>
    <p>
        Several of the components in the head of this page require you to be logged in to OMERO.
        So, this page uses the @login_required() decorator so you will need to log in to see this page.
        
        We also use the @render_response() decorator to add various details to the context that is 
        passed to this page, for example...
    </p>
    <h1>You are currently logged in as: 
        <span style="background: white; padding:10px; border:solid #bbb 1px">
            {{ ome.user.getFullName }}
        </span>
    </h1>

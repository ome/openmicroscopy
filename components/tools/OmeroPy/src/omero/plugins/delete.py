Remove entire graphs of data based on the ID of the top-node.

By default linked tag, file and term annotations are not deleted.
To delete linked annoations they must be explicitly included.

Examples:

    # Delete an image but not its linked tag, file and term annotations
    omero delete Image:50
    # Delete an image including linked tag, file and term annotations
    omero delete Image:51 --include TagAnnotation,FileAnnotation,TermAnnotation
    # Delete an image including all linked annotations
    omero delete Image:52 --include Annotation

    # Delete three images and two datasets including their contents
    omero delete Image:101,102,103 Dataset:201,202
    # Delete five images and four datasets including their contents
    # Note that --force flag is required when deleting a range, if not
    # passed, a dry run is performed
    omero delete Image:106-110 Dataset:203-205,207 --force
    # Delete a project excluding contained datasets and linked annotations
    omero delete Project:101 --exclude Dataset,Annotation

    # Delete all images contained under a project
    omero delete Project/Dataset/Image:53
    # Delete all images contained under two projects
    omero delete Project/Image:201,202

    # Do a dry run of a delete reporting the outcome if the delete had been run
    omero delete Dataset:53 --dry-run
    # Do a dry run of a delete, reporting all the objects
    # that would have been deleted

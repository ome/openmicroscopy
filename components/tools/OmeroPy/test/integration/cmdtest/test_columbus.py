"""
   Test of the omero.cmd.Chgrp and Chown Request types
   as specified by Bernhard Hollaender of Perkin Elmer:

"These are quite complex demands and I reckon and probably not the most
obvious ones. Anyways, I'd really like the sharing options to work a bit
more like in social networks. In principle it should be possible to share
data with anyone and it should be possible to share data with groups and
individuals in the same way. It should also be possible to revoke access to
datasets for individuals and groups. In case something should be deleted,
there should be no restrictions because other users may have linked anything
to the dataset in question. The special cases fro group administrators are
not so important I would guess it is ok not to have extra access rights,
except that they should be able to delete users and data from their group."

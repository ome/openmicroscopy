        Test attempts to compare a full image plane, cropped to a region, with
        a region retrieved from rendering engine.

        Uses PIL to convert compressed strings into 2D numpy arrays for
        cropping and comparison. ** Although cropped images and retrieved
        regions APPEAR identical, there appear to be rounding or rendering
        errors, either in the 'renderCompressed' method of the rendering engine
        or in PIL **

        For this reason, there are small differences in the pixel values of
        rendered regions. This functionality is also tested in Java. Therefore
        this test is not 'Activated' currently.

% GETSCREENFILEANNOTATIONS Retrieve file annotations linked to screens
%
%    fas = getScreenFileAnnotations(session, ids) returns all file
%    annotations linked to the screens specified by the input identifiers
%    and owned by the session user.
%
%    fas = getScreenFileAnnotations(session, screens) returns all file

%
%    fas = getScreenFileAnnotations(session,  ids, 'include', include) only

%
%    fas = getScreenFileAnnotations(session,  ids, 'exclude', exclude)
%    excludes file annotations with the input namespace.

%    Examples:

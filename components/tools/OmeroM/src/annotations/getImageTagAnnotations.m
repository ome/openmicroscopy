% GETIMAGETAGANNOTATIONS Retrieve tag annotations linked to images
%
%    tas = getImageTagAnnotations(session, ids) returns all tag annotations
%    linked to the image specified by the input identifiers ids and owned 
%    by the session user.
%
%    tas = getImageTagAnnotations(session, images) returns all tag
%    annotations linked to the input images and owned by the session user.
%
%    tas = getImageTagAnnotations(session,  ids, 'include', include) only
%    returns tag annotations with the input namespace.
%
%    tas = getImageTagAnnotations(session,  ids, 'exclude', exclude)
%    excludes tag annotations with the input namespace.
%
%    Examples:
%
%        tas = getImageTagAnnotations(session, ids)
%        tas = getImageTagAnnotations(session, images)
%        tas = getImageTagAnnotations(session, ids, 'include', include)
%        tas = getImageTagAnnotations(session, ids, 'exclude', exclude)

function unloadOmero(varargin)
% Remove OMERO.matlab from the path and javaclasspath.
%
% Remove's all OMERO resources from MATLAB path and javaclasspath
% silencing any warnings about the given paths not being available.
% If loadOmero was called from another directory, this method will
% not be able to remove the paths. Use the unloadOmero method from
% that directory. (In that case, the other unloadOmero should be on
% your path anyway; changing directories might suffice).
%
% This method also calls 'clear java' but does not try to silence
% messages. Any warnings show that objects are still in your work-
% space which hold on to Java objects, which therefore can't be
% cleaned. Strange JVM/Classpath errors may occcur if you do not
% clear the variables and then 'clear java' again.

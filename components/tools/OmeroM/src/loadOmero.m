function [client, session] = loadOmero(varargin)
% LOADOMERO Add OMERO.matlab to the MATLAB path and Java class path, and optionally login.
%
%   loadOmero()  specifies the directory of the current method as an
%   OMERO.matlab toolbox installation, and adds it to the path and the
%   dynamic javaclasspath. (If you have already specified an OMERO jar on
%   your static classpath via classpath.txt, it will take priority. Please
%   remove it to use loadOmero)
%
%   client = loadOmero() adds OMERO.matlab to the Matlab path and Java
%   class path and connects to a server using the properties specified by
%   the ice.config file at the root of the OMERO.matlab directory.
%
%   [client, session] = loadOmero() also creates a session on this server
%   using the properties specified in the ice.config file at the root of
%   the OMERO.matlab directory.
%
%   client = loadOmero(server) adds OMERO.matlab to the Matlab path and
%   Java class path and connects to the input server.
%
%   client = loadOmero(server, port) adds OMERO.matlab to the Matlab path
%   and Java class path and connects to the input server using the input
%   port number
%
%   client = loadOmero(properties) adds OMERO.matlab to the Matlab path
%   and Java class path and connects to a server using the value of
%   'omero.host' stored in the input properties of java.util.Properties.
%
%   [client, session] = loadOmero(properties) also creates a session using
%   the values of 'omero.user' and 'omero.pass' stored in the input
%   properties.
%
%   client = loadOmero(config_file) adds OMERO.matlab to the Matlab path
%   and Java class path and connects to the input server using the Ice
%   configuration file located in the input config_file path.
%
%   [client, session] = loadOmero(config_file) alsoe creates a session
%   using the configuration file located in the input config_file path.

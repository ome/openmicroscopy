function deleteObjects(session, ids, type)
% DELETEOBJECTS Delete objects of a given type from the OMERO server
%
%   objects = deleteObjects(session, ids, type) returns all the objects of
%   the specified type, identified by the input ids. All annotations (tags,
%   files...) linked to the objects will either be deleted if not shared
%   with other objects or unlinked if shared with other objects.

%   Examples:
%
%      objects = deleteObjects(session, ids, type);

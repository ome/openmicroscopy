  
  Open Microscopy Environment - Install Notes (Java Client)
  ---------------------------------------------------------

  ________
  Preamble

  The client software requires a J2SE Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to
  run (version 1.5 or higher). 
  If you don't have one already, you can download the J2SE JRE install bundle 
  from:

    http://java.sun.com/j2se/downloads/


  NOTE
  You don't need to download the whole J2SE SDK, just the JRE is enough.
 

  _________________
  Install Procedure

  Extract the downloaded bundle in any directory on your local file system.
  After doing this, your directory should contain:

    * A "config" directory.
    * A "lib" directory.
    * A "omeroclient.jar" file.
    * A startup script for Windows, Unix and Mac OS X.
    * A "LICENSE" file.
    * This install file.

  
  If you're running on Unix or Mac OS X, make sure the provided startup script
  is executable.


  ____________________
  Running The Software

  Double-click on the startup script (for example "OMEROinsight_windows.bat") 
  file within the installation directory. A splash screen will pop up. 
  Enter your OMERO user name, password and the name of the server then press
  the log in button.  Enjoy OMERO!

  If you want to run the editor as a standalone application,
  double-click on the startup script (for example "OMEROeditor_windows.bat") 
  file within the installation directory. A splash screen will pop up.

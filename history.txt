OMERO version history
=====================

5.4.7 (July 2018)
-----------------

This is a security release which also includes a number of
bug fixes. **It is highly recommended that you upgrade your
server**.

See the :secvuln:`security advisories <>` page for details on
2018-SV1, 2018-SV2 and 2018-SV3.

Impacts of the security vulnerability fixes include:

- omero.security.password_required=false no longer applies for
  administrators: their correct password is always required
- administrators can no longer change the password of other
  administrators who are more privileged in any way
- administrators can no longer reset their password and receive the new
  one by e-mail: they must instead have another administrator who is at
  least as privileged set a new password manually
- cli: the session UUID has been removed from the standard output when
  logging in but can still be retrieved using `bin/omero sessions key`

Improvements include:

-  web: fix loss of privileges when editing full admins
-  web: fix exceptions on invalid connections
-  web: fix CSS in group/user search element
-  web: fix error when public user is disabled
-  web: gray out user role when editing root user
-  insight: permit open_with on original files
-  read-only: reduce error logging for scripts and pixel data
-  scripts: improve error messages for invalid MATLAB
-  as well as various documentation improvements

Sysadmin improvements include:

-  log locale and time zone information on startup

Developer updates include:

-  cli: clean up "communicator not destroyed" logging
-  cli: don't hang when incorrect password passed in a script
-  java: add a map annotation example
-  java: throw a clear exception when -1 is used for all groups
-  web: fix @render_response when extending base templates
-  matlab: contributions from Kouichi Nakamura for working with annotations

This release also upgrades the version of Bio-Formats which OMERO
uses to 5.9.0. **Note:** this is a significant upgrade and will
invalidate the Bio-Formats Memoizer cache. Please see the upgrade
guide for further information.

5.4.6 (May 2018)
----------------

This introduces a significant new subsystem for read-only operation with which
servers can be configured not to make changes to the database, the filesystem, or both. 
The goal is to permit horizontal scaling of OMERO by running multiple servers in parallel
to increase the throughput of data and metadata for large-scale analysis or publishing.
Additionally, a read-only copy of an existing OMERO can be opened safely to the public
for experimentation. For example, this infrastructure supports the public OMERO web
and the Jupyter environment of the 
`Image Data Resource <https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/>`_.
Information on how to configure a read-only server
is available at :doc:`/developers/Server/Clustering`.

Further improvements include:

-  enabled big image support in ImageJ/Fiji
-  reduced the number of threads used by OMERO.web
-  fixed other bugs in OMERO.web including:

   - broken History tab
   - handling of script params
   - pagination calculations
   - public user login
   - browsing to user's data in IE
-  fixed the chosen login ports for OMERO.cli

Developer updates include:

-  a new command to set custom physical pixel size using OMERO.cli
-  deprecated Repository::pixels, TinyImportFixture and OMEROImportFixture
-  improved test infrastructure
-  reduced background events in the center panel plugin when not displaying Thumbnails
-  added extra controls when specifying map and gamma in the rendering engine

This release also upgrades the version of Bio-Formats which OMERO
uses to 5.8.2. **Note:** this is a significant upgrade and will
invalidate the Bio-Formats Memoizer cache. Please see the upgrade
guide for further information.

5.4.5 (March 2018)
------------------

other people's data by creating an original file and changing its path to
point to another user's file on the underlying filesystem.

:secvuln:`2017-SV2-edit-rw` prevents users in read-write groups from
editing official scripts.

:secvuln:`2017-SV3-delete-script` prevents the deletion of official
scripts by users without the correct permissions to do so.

It is highly recommended that you upgrade your server.

5.2.7 (December 2016)
---------------------

This is a release aimed at system administrators or developers wanting to
build OMERO with Ice 3.6.3.

This release also upgrades the version of Bio-Formats which OMERO uses to
`5.1.10 <https://www.openmicroscopy.org/2016/05/09/bio-formats-5-1-10.html>`_.

All scripts handling Regions of Interest (ROIs) now support ROI not linked to
any plane as defined by the OME Model.

likely to be removed during the 5.3.x line.

5.2.5 (August 2016)
-------------------

This is a security release to fix the access privileges of the share function,
which were potentially allowing users to access private data belonging to
other users via the API.

See :secvuln:`2016-SV2-share` for details. Shares will now respect user
privileges as set by the group permission level. Note that Shares now
**only** support images even when used via the API.

It is highly recommended that you upgrade your server. For those not in a
position to do so as a matter of urgency, a workaround is provided which
deletes all shares and disables their creation.

5.2.4 (May 2016)
----------------

This is a security release to fix the cleanse.py script used by the "bin/omero
admin cleanse" command, which was not properly respecting user permissions and
may lead to data loss.

See :secvuln:`2016-SV1-cleanse` for details. The script and command have now
been made admin-only.

It is highly suggested that you upgrade your server or apply the patch
available from the security page.

-  rendering fixes for floating point data
-  Admins can now configure whether the clients interpolate images by default
-  better formatting of Delta-T and exposure times in the clients
-  directories are now preserved when downloading multiple original files
-  various improvements to the OMERO-ImageJ handling of ROIs and measurements,
   including the ability to name measurement tables
-  current session key can now be returned via the CLI

Support for deployment of OMERO.web using FastCGI has also been deprecated in
this release and is scheduled to be removed in 5.2.0. Sysadmins should move to
using WSGI instead. We are also intending to stop distributing Java Webstart
for launching OMERO.insight from your browser, as security concerns mean
browsers are increasingly moving away from supporting this type of
application. You can read further information regarding this decision on our `Web Start blog post <http://blog.openmicroscopy.org/tech-issues/future-plans/2015/09/23/java-web-start/>`_.

5.1.3 (July 2015)
-----------------

A bug-fix release which also introduces some new functionality. Improvements
include:

-  tagging actions extended; you can now use tag sets to tag images on import
-  tagging ome-tiff images at import has also been fixed
-  greatly improved workflow and bug fixes for the Share functionality in
   OMERO.web which enables you to share images with users outside of your
   group (including removal of part of the UI)
-  group admins and owners can now change ownership of data via the CLI
-  better reporting for the 'delete' and 'chgrp' functionality in the CLI
-  fixed display of images in plates with multiple acquisitions
-  fixed export of results as .xls files from OMERO.insight
-  improved workflow for ImageJ and OMERO interactions
-  support for WSGI OMERO.web deployment
-  fixed OMERO.mail service for web errors
-  fixes for ROI display in OMERO.web (thanks to Luca Lianas of CRS4)
-  fixes and workflow improvements for running scripts and script dialogs

Developer updates include:

-  OMERO.web clean-up (removal of '-locked')
-  reorganization of the server bundle to move various licenses and 
   dependencies under a new 'share' folder
-  refactoring of 'Chown2', 'Chmod2', 'Chgrp2' and 'Delete2'
-  addition of dynamic scripts
-  the 'rstring' implementation is now more lenient and should better handle
   unicode
-  Bio-Formats submodule removed from OMERO; decoupling effort means OMERO now
   consumes the Bio-Formats release build from the artifactory

This release also includes the fix for the Java security issue, as discussed
in the
`recent blog post <http://blog.openmicroscopy.org/tech-issues/2015/07/21/java-issue/>`_. Testing
suggests this fix should not have any performance implications. You should
upgrade your Java version to take advantage of the security fix.

This is a bug-fix release addressing a number of issues across all components,
including:

-  import improvements for large image datasets
-  shared rendering settings
-  better tagging workflows
-  disk space usage reporting for OMERO.web admins
-  OMERO.matlab annotation handling
-  custom Web Start intro page templates
-  searching by image ID

To take advantage of improvements in Bio-Formats support for .czi files, you

4.4.11 (April 2014)
-------------------

This is a bug-fix release for the Java Web Start issue. You only need to
upgrade if this is a blocker for you and you cannot upgrade to 5.0.x as yet.
Also note that the OMERO.insight-ij plugin version 4.4.x no longer works for
Fiji, we are working on a fix for this. Plugin version 5.0.x is unaffected.

5.0.0 (February 2014)
---------------------

This represents a major change in how the OMERO server handles files at import
compared with all previous versions of OMERO. Referred to as 'OMERO.fs', this
change means that OMERO uses Bio-Formats to read your files directly from the
filesystem in their original format, rather than converting them and
duplicating the pixel data for storage. In addition, it continues our effort
to support new multidimensional images. The changes are especially important
for sites working with large multi-GB datasets, e.g. long time lapse, HCS and
digital pathology data.

also including:

-  Ice compatibility issues
-  new scripting sharing service 
-  new user help website
-  new partner project pages.

The minimum system requirement is Java 1.6 (Java 1.5 is no longer supported).

A security vulnerability was identified and resolved, meaning that we strongly
recommend all users upgrade their OMERO clients and servers.

4.4.8p1 (July 2013)
-------------------

This is a patch release addressing a network connection problem in the clients
introduced by a new version of Java.

4.4.8 (May 2013)
----------------

This is bug-fix release addressing two specific issues: a problem with the
OMERO.insight client for Linux, and image thumbnails not loading for
Screens/Plates in Private/Read-Only groups in OMERO.web. You only need to
upgrade if you are an OMERO.insight user on Linux or you are using OMERO.web
to view HCS data in Private or Read-Only groups.

4.4.7 (April 2013)
------------------

This is a point release including several new features and fixes across all
components. This includes improvements in viewing of 'Big' tiled images, new
permission features, new OMERO.web features, and several utility functions in
OMERO.matlab.

4.4.6 (February 2013)
---------------------

This is bug-fix release addressing a number of issues across all components.

   as well as fixes for file downloads above 2GB, permissions, memory leaks
   and JDK5.

4.4.3 (August 2012)
-------------------

This is a critical security fix for:

-  :secvuln:`2012-SV1-ldap-authentication`

Anyone using OMERO 4.4.2 or earlier with LDAP
authentication should immediately upgrade to 4.4.3.

4.4.2 (August 2012)
-------------------

This release is a major bug fix for archiving files larger than 2 GB. If you
do not archive files larger than 2 GB, you do not need to upgrade your clients
or your server. There is also a minor fix for an OMERO.imagej plugin security
issue, but it is only necessary to update the version of Bio-Formats that is
installed in ImageJ.

4.4.1 (July 2012)
-----------------

This is a minor release which fixes two import issues. See :ticket:`9372`
and :ticket:`9377`. If you are not using BigTIFF or PerkinElmer .flex files,
then you do not need to upgrade.

4.4.0 (July 2012)
-----------------

This is a major release, which focuses on providing new
functionality for controlling access to data, as well as significant
improvements in our client applications.

The major theme of 4.4.0 is what we refer to as "Permissions", the system by which users control access to their data. It is now possible to move data
between groups, and much, much more.

We also added a few more things for users in 4.4.0, like:

-  OMERO.insight webstart
-  Importing from OMERO.insight is now complete
-  Better integration of OMERO.insight with ImageJ
-  A bottom-to-top reworking of the OMERO.web design

For developers and sysadmins, there are a few things as well:

-  Support for Ice 3.4
-  Removed support for PostgreSQL 8.3

Beta 4.3.4 (January 2012)
-------------------------

This is a point release is a security update to address an LDAP vulnerability.

Beta 4.3.3 (October 2011)
-------------------------

This point release is a short follow on to 4.3.2 to handle various issues
found by users.

Beta 4.3.2 (September 2011)
---------------------------

This is a point release, focusing on fixes for OMERO.web, export, and
documentation. A couple of LDAP fixes were also added, following requests from
the community. We also included something many of you have asked for some
time, OMERO on virtual machines.

Beta 4.3.1 (July 2011)
----------------------

This point release focuses on fixes for Big Images, OMERO.web and others.

Beta 4.3.0 (June 2011)
----------------------

This is a major release, focusing on new functionality for large,
tiled images, and significant improvements in our client applications.

The major theme of 4.3.0 is what we refer to as "Big Images", namely images
with X,Y images larger that 4k x 4k. With this release, OMERO's server and
Java and web clients support tiling and image pyramids. This means we have the
functionality you have probably seen in online map tools, ready for use in any
image file format supported by OMERO (and obviously Bio-Formats). This is
especially important for digital pathology, and other uses of stitched 
imaging.

While the major focus of 4.3.0 was Big Images, there are a number of other new
updates. For users, we have worked hard to synchronise functionality and
appearance across the OMERO clients. This includes viewing of ROIs in
OMERO.web. We are not done, but we have made a lot of progress. Moreover, data
import is now MUCH faster and available from within OMERO.insight.

Beta 4.2.2 (December 2010)
--------------------------

Fixes blocker reported using 4.2.1. Starting with this milestone, all tickets
for the insight client are managed on Trac.

Beta 4.2.1 (November 2010)
--------------------------

This is a point release, focusing on fixes for delete functionality, and
significant improvements in the way OMERO.web production server is deployed.

Beta 4.2.0 (July 2010)
----------------------

This release is a major step for OMERO, enabling a number of critical features
for a fully functional data management system:

-  User and Group Permissions and data visibility between users
-  updates to the OME SPW Model and improvements in HCS data visualisation
-  SSL connection between OMERO clients and server;
-  full scripting system, accessible from command line and within 
   OMERO.insight, including Figure Export and FLIM Analysis
-  ROIs generated in OMERO.insight stored on server
-  extended use of OMERO.Tables for analysis results
-  performance improvements for import and server-side import histories
-  revamped, fully functional OMERO.web web browser interface
-  upgrade of Backend libraries in OMERO.server

Beta 4.1.1 (December 2009)
--------------------------

This release fixes a series of small bugs in our previous Beta 4.1 release.

Beta 4.1 (October 2009)
-----------------------

Improved support for metadata, especially for confocal microscopy; OMERO
supports all of the file formats enabled by Bio-Formats. Export to OME-TIFF
and QuickTime/AVI/MPEG from OMERO. Various improvements to OMERO clients to
improve workflow and use.

This release introduces OMERO.qa - a feedback mechanism, to allow us to
communicate more effectively with our community. OMERO.qa supports uploading
of problematic files, and tracking of responses to any user queries. Moreover,
OMERO.qa includes a demo feature: in collaboration with Urban Liebel at
Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, we are providing demo accounts for OMERO.
Use the Demo link at qa to contact us if you are interested in this.

For users who have had problems with memory-based
crashes in OMERO.insight, the new OpenGL-based ImageViewer may be of interest.
Also, we are now taking advantage of our modeling of HCS data, and releasing
our first clients that support Flex, MIAS, and InCell 1000 file formats.
OMERO.dropbox has been substantially extended, and now supports all the file
formats supported by OMERO.

Beta 4.0.1 (April 2009)
-----------------------

A quick patch release that fixes some bugs and adds some new functionality:

-  Fixed Windows installation and updated docs.
-  Bug fixes (scriptingEngine, importer).
-  Fix .lif import, add Li-Cor 2D (OMERO does gels!).
-  API .dv and OME .ome.tiff now supported by OMERO.fs.
-  Support negative pixel values in Rendering Engine.
-  Archived images are now fully supported in OMERO.
-  OMERO.web merged with OmeroPy in distribution.

Beta 4.0 (March 2009)
---------------------

This release consists of a major change in the remoting infrastructure,
complete migration of existing OMERO clients to the ICE framework, two new
OMERO clients, and integration of OMERO.editor into OMERO.insight.

OMERO.server updates:

-  remove JBOSS, and switch all remoting to ICE
-  improve session management, supporting creation of many thousands of
   session
-  addition of an import service for server-side importing
-  DB upgrades to support the metadata completion facilities
-  substantial improvement to the interaction between the indexing engine and
   the rest of server.

OMERO.web: all new browser-based client for OMERO. Enables sharing of images
with colleagues with an account on server.

OMERO.editor: a management tool for experimental protocols, now fully
integrated with OMERO.insight, so that protocols and experimental descriptions
can be saved along with images and datasets. Includes a new parameters
function, so that protocols in traditional documents can be easily imported
into OMERO. Supports, tables and .xls files. Also runs as a standalone
application.

OMERO.fs: a new OMERO client, that monitors a specific directory and enables
automatic imports. In its first incarnation, has quite limited functionality,
supporting automatic import of LSM510 files only.

Beta 3.2 (November 2008)
------------------------

The final update in the Beta3.x series. A number of fixes:

Beta 3.0 (June 2008)
--------------------

This release of OMERO is a major update of functionality. In OMERO.server, we
have added support for StructuredAnnotations a flexible data management
facility that allows essentially any kind of accessory data to be linked to
images and experiments stored in OMERO. Alongside this, we provide an indexing
engine, that provides a flexible searching facility for essentially any text
stored in an installation of OMERO.server. Finally, we are releasing our first
examples of clients that use the OMERO.blitz server, a flexible, distributed
interface that supports a range of client environments. One very exciting
addition is OMERO matlab, a gateway that can be used to access OMERO from
Matlab®.

OMERO Beta3.0 includes a substantial reworking of our clients as well.
OMERO.insight has been substantially updated, with an updated interface to
provide a more natural workflow and support for many different types of
annotations, through the StructuredAnnotations facility. The new search
facilities are supported with smart user interfaces, with auto-complete, etc.
New file formats have been added to OMERO.importer, including support for
OME-XML, and an improved import history facility is now available. Finally,
Beta3.0 includes the first release of our experimental electronic notebook
tool, OMERO.editor. This represents our recent efforts to capture as much
metadata around an experiment as possible.

Beta 2.3.3 insight (April 2008)
-------------------------------

A new Beta 2.3.3 OMERO.insight has been released, this adds rotation to
ellipse figure, and new format for saving intensity values.

Note: this version saves the ROIs in a format which is incompatible with
previous saved ROIs.

Beta 2.3.1 importer (February 2008)
-----------------------------------

A new Beta 2.3.1 OMERO.importer has been released which includes a number of
new formats: Zeiss AxioVision ZVI (Zeiss Vision Image), Nikon NIS-Elements
.ND2 , Olympus FluoView FV1000, ICS (Image Cytometry Standard), PerkinElmer
UltraView, and Jpeg2000.

The OMERO downloads for Beta 2.3 include a number of new options: a
new import history feature, a Windows server installation, and a new tagging
feature for OMERO.insight.

Note: milestone:3.0-Beta2.3 and prior Mac OS X installers for OMERO.server do
not work on Mac OS X Leopard (10.5). Please follow the UNIX-based platform
manual install instructions. Mac OS X installers for OMERO.insight and
OMERO.importer work just fine under Leopard and can be used.

Beta 2.3 (December 2007)
------------------------

This is a patch release for OMERO.server to fix a memory problem. In
OMERO.insight, updating of the tagging facility, viewing of others' rendering
settings and support for server-side compression of images before transport to
client.

Beta 2.2 (November 2007)
------------------------

In this release we have updated OMERO.server to run a newer version of JBOSS
and provided support for copying display settings across a range of images.
More new file formats. OMERO.insight has been updated to support copying
display settings across many images. Image Viewer has been substantially
updated.

Beta 2.1 (August 2007)
----------------------

This is a client-only release. OMERO.insight now supports basic ROI
measurements and a series of new file formats have been added. The OMERO
downloads for Beta 2.0 have been simplified. OMERO.insight and OMERO.importer
have been combined into a single download file called 'OMERO.clients' and the
user documentation is now included inside of the server and client downloads.

Beta 2.0 (June 2007)
--------------------

Note: this version will still work with the Beta 1 server release.

This major update provided our first support for multiple platforms via
OMERO.Blitz. OMERO.insight now supports viewing work of multiple users. Beta 2
is our first release of the Web2.0-like 'tag' system developed in
collaboration with Usable Image from Dundee University Computing department.
This version addresses issues with using our tools under Java 1.6

5.0.0 (February 2014)
---------------------

This represents a major change in how the OMERO server handles files at import
compared with all previous versions of OMERO. Referred to as 'OMERO.fs', this
change means that OMERO uses Bio-Formats to read your files directly from the
filesystem in their original format, rather than converting them and
duplicating the pixel data for storage. In addition, it continues our effort
to support new multidimensional images. The changes are especially important
for sites working with large multi-GB datasets, e.g. long time lapse, HCS and
digital pathology data.

also including:

-  Ice compatibility issues
-  new scripting sharing service 
-  new user help website
-  new partner project pages.

The minimum system requirement is Java 1.6 (Java 1.5 is no longer supported).

A security vulnerability was identified and resolved, meaning that we strongly
recommend all users upgrade their OMERO clients and servers.

4.4.8p1 (July 2013)
-------------------

This is a patch release addressing a network connection problem in the clients
introduced by a new version of Java.

4.4.8 (May 2013)
----------------

This is bug-fix release addressing two specific issues: a problem with the
OMERO.insight client for Linux, and image thumbnails not loading for
Screens/Plates in Private/Read-Only groups in OMERO.web. You only need to
upgrade if you are an OMERO.insight user on Linux or you are using OMERO.web
to view HCS data in Private or Read-Only groups.

4.4.7 (April 2013)
------------------

This is a point release including several new features and fixes across all
components. This includes improvements in viewing of 'Big' tiled images, new
permission features, new OMERO.web features, and several utility functions in
OMERO.matlab.

   as well as fixes for file downloads above 2GB, permissions, memory leaks
   and JDK5.

4.4.3 (August 2012)
-------------------

This is a critical security fix for:

-  :secvuln:`2012-SV1-ldap-authentication`

Anyone using OMERO 4.4.2 or earlier with LDAP
authentication should immediately upgrade to 4.4.3.

4.4.2 (August 2012)
-------------------

This release is a major bug fix for archiving files larger than 2 GB. If you
do not archive files larger than 2 GB, you do not need to upgrade your clients
or your server. There is also a minor fix for an OMERO.imagej plugin security
issue, but it is only necessary to update the version of Bio-Formats that is
installed in ImageJ.

4.4.1 (July 2012)
-----------------

This is a minor release which fixes two import issues. See :ticket:`9372`
and :ticket:`9377`. If you are not using BigTIFF or PerkinElmer .flex files,
then you do not need to upgrade.

4.4.0 (July 2012)
-----------------

This is a major release, which focuses on providing new
functionality for controlling access to data, as well as significant
improvements in our client applications.

The major theme of 4.4.0 is what we refer to as "Permissions", the system by which users control access to their data. It is now possible to move data
between groups, and much, much more.

We also added a few more things for users in 4.4.0, like:

-  OMERO.insight webstart
-  Importing from OMERO.insight is now complete
-  Better integration of OMERO.insight with ImageJ
-  A bottom-to-top reworking of the OMERO.web design

For developers and sysadmins, there are a few things as well:

-  Support for Ice 3.4
-  Removed support for PostgreSQL 8.3

Beta 4.3.4 (January 2012)
-------------------------

This is a point release is a security update to address an LDAP vulnerability.

Beta 4.3.3 (October 2011)
-------------------------

This point release is a short follow on to 4.3.2 to handle various issues
found by users.

Beta 4.3.2 (September 2011)
---------------------------

This is a point release, focusing on fixes for OMERO.web, export, and
documentation. A couple of LDAP fixes were also added, following requests from
the community. We also included something many of you have asked for some
time, OMERO on virtual machines.

Beta 4.3.1 (July 2011)
----------------------

This point release focuses on fixes for Big Images, OMERO.web and others.

Beta 4.3.0 (June 2011)
----------------------

This is a major release, focusing on new functionality for large,
tiled images, and significant improvements in our client applications.

The major theme of 4.3.0 is what we refer to as "Big Images", namely images
with X,Y images larger that 4k x 4k. With this release, OMERO's server and
Java and web clients support tiling and image pyramids. This means we have the
functionality you have probably seen in online map tools, ready for use in any
image file format supported by OMERO (and obviously Bio-Formats). This is
especially important for digital pathology, and other uses of stitched 
imaging.

While the major focus of 4.3.0 was Big Images, there are a number of other new
updates. For users, we have worked hard to synchronise functionality and
appearance across the OMERO clients. This includes viewing of ROIs in
OMERO.web. We are not done, but we have made a lot of progress. Moreover, data
import is now MUCH faster and available from within OMERO.insight.

Beta 4.2.2 (December 2010)
--------------------------

Fixes blocker reported using 4.2.1. Starting with this milestone, all tickets
for the insight client are managed on Trac.

Beta 4.2.1 (November 2010)
--------------------------

This is a point release, focusing on fixes for delete functionality, and
significant improvements in the way OMERO.web production server is deployed.

Beta 4.2.0 (July 2010)
----------------------

This release is a major step for OMERO, enabling a number of critical features
for a fully functional data management system:

-  User and Group Permissions and data visibility between users
-  updates to the OME SPW Model and improvements in HCS data visualisation
-  SSL connection between OMERO clients and server;
-  full scripting system, accessible from command line and within 
   OMERO.insight, including Figure Export and FLIM Analysis
-  ROIs generated in OMERO.insight stored on server
-  extended use of OMERO.Tables for analysis results
-  performance improvements for import and server-side import histories
-  revamped, fully functional OMERO.web web browser interface
-  upgrade of Backend libraries in OMERO.server

Beta 4.1.1 (December 2009)
--------------------------

This release fixes a series of small bugs in our previous Beta 4.1 release.

Beta 4.1 (October 2009)
-----------------------

Improved support for metadata, especially for confocal microscopy; OMERO
supports all of the file formats enabled by Bio-Formats. Export to OME-TIFF
and QuickTime/AVI/MPEG from OMERO. Various improvements to OMERO clients to
improve workflow and use.

This release introduces OMERO.qa - a feedback mechanism, to allow us to
communicate more effectively with our community. OMERO.qa supports uploading
of problematic files, and tracking of responses to any user queries. Moreover,
OMERO.qa includes a demo feature: in collaboration with Urban Liebel at
Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, we are providing demo accounts for OMERO.
Use the Demo link at qa to contact us if you are interested in this.

For users who have had problems with memory-based
crashes in OMERO.insight, the new OpenGL-based ImageViewer may be of interest.
Also, we are now taking advantage of our modeling of HCS data, and releasing
our first clients that support Flex, MIAS, and InCell 1000 file formats.
OMERO.dropbox has been substantially extended, and now supports all the file
formats supported by OMERO.

Beta 4.0.1 (April 2009)
-----------------------

with colleagues with an account on server.

OMERO.editor: a management tool for experimental protocols, now fully
integrated with OMERO.insight, so that protocols and experimental descriptions
can be saved along with images and datasets. Includes a new parameters
function, so that protocols in traditional documents can be easily imported
into OMERO. Supports, tables and .xls files. Also runs as a standalone
application.

OMERO.fs: a new OMERO client, that monitors a specific directory and enables
automatic imports. In its first incarnation, has quite limited functionality,
supporting automatic import of LSM510 files only.

have added support for StructuredAnnotations a flexible data management
facility that allows essentially any kind of accessory data to be linked to
images and experiments stored in OMERO. Alongside this, we provide an indexing
engine, that provides a flexible searching facility for essentially any text
stored in an installation of OMERO.server. Finally, we are releasing our first
examples of clients that use the OMERO.blitz server, a flexible, distributed
interface that supports a range of client environments. One very exciting
addition is OMERO matlab, a gateway that can be used to access OMERO from
Matlab®.

OMERO Beta3.0 includes a substantial reworking of our clients as well.
OMERO.insight has been substantially updated, with an updated interface to
provide a more natural workflow and support for many different types of
annotations, through the StructuredAnnotations facility. The new search
facilities are supported with smart user interfaces, with auto-complete, etc.
New file formats have been added to OMERO.importer, including support for
OME-XML, and an improved import history facility is now available. Finally,
Beta3.0 includes the first release of our experimental electronic notebook
tool, OMERO.editor. This represents our recent efforts to capture as much
metadata around an experiment as possible.

Beta 2.3.3 insight (April 2008)
-------------------------------

A new Beta 2.3.3 OMERO.insight has been released, this adds rotation to
ellipse figure, and new format for saving intensity values.

Note: this version saves the ROIs in a format which is incompatible with
previous saved ROIs.

Beta 2.3.1 importer (February 2008)
-----------------------------------

A new Beta 2.3.1 OMERO.importer has been released which includes a number of
new formats: Zeiss AxioVision ZVI (Zeiss Vision Image), Nikon NIS-Elements
.ND2 , Olympus FluoView FV1000, ICS (Image Cytometry Standard), PerkinElmer
UltraView, and Jpeg2000.

The OMERO downloads for Beta 2.3 include a number of new options: a
new import history feature, a Windows server installation, and a new tagging
feature for OMERO.insight.

Note: milestone:3.0-Beta2.3 and prior Mac OS X installers for OMERO.server do
not work on Mac OS X Leopard (10.5). Please follow the UNIX-based platform
manual install instructions. Mac OS X installers for OMERO.insight and
OMERO.importer work just fine under Leopard and can be used.

Beta 2.3 (December 2007)

measurements and a series of new file formats have been added. The OMERO
downloads for Beta 2.0 have been simplified. OMERO.insight and OMERO.importer
have been combined into a single download file called 'OMERO.clients' and the
user documentation is now included inside of the server and client downloads.

Beta 2.0 (June 2007)
--------------------

Note: this version will still work with the Beta 1 server release.

This major update provided our first support for multiple platforms via
OMERO.Blitz. OMERO.insight now supports viewing work of multiple users. Beta 2
is our first release of the Web2.0-like 'tag' system developed in
collaboration with :about_plone:`Usable Image <project-history/catriona>`.
This version addresses issues with using our tools under Java 1.6

Beta 1.1 (March 2007)

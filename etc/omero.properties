## Any of these properties can be altered by using bin/omero config. MODIFYING
## THIS FILE DOES NOT ALTER SERVER BEHAVIOR. It solely defines the defaults

## Policies & restrictions
#########################################################

# Instance of the PolicyService interface which
# will be responsible for checking certain server
# actions made by a user.
omero.policy.bean=defaultPolicyService

# Configuration for the policy of whether users
# can access binary files from disk. Binary access
# includes all attempts to download a file from the
# UI.
#
# The individual components of the string include:
#
# - write - whether or not users who have WRITE
#   access to the objects can access the binary.
#   This includes group and system administrators.
#
# - read - whether or not users who have READ
#   access to the objects can access the binary.
#
# - image - whether or not images are to be considered
#   accessible as a rule.
#
# - plate - whether or not plates and contained HCS
#   objects are to be considered accessible as a rule.
#   This includes wells, well samples, and plate runs.
#
# Though the order of the components of the property
# are not important, the order that they are listed above
# roughly corresponds to their priority. E.g. a -write
# value will override +plate.
#
# Example 1: "-read,+write,+image,-plate" only owners
# of an image and admins can download it.
#
# Example 2: "-read,-write,-image,-plate" no downloading
# is possible.
#
# Configuration properties of the same name can be applied
# to individual groups as well. E.g. adding,
# omero.policy.binary_access=-read to a group, you can
# prevent group-members from downloading original files.
#
# Configuration is pessimistic: if there is a negative
# *either* on the group *or* at the server-level, the
# restriction will be applied. A missing value at the
# server restricts the setting but allows the server
# to override.
#
omero.policy.binary_access=+read,+write,+image

# the same filter as ``:query:`` does. e.g.
# ``omero.ldap.new_user_group=:filtered_attribute:memberOf``
#
# Similar to ``:attribute:``, ``:dn_attribute:`` uses all the
# values of the specified attribute as the DN of
# multiple OMERO groups. e.g.
# ``omero.ldap.new_user_group=:dn_attribute:memberOf``
#
# A combination of filtered_attribute and dn_attribute,
# ``:filtered_dn_attribute:`` uses all of the values of the
# specified attribute as the DN of multiple OMERO groups
# but the attribute must pass the same filter as ``:query:``
# e.g. ``omero.ldap.new_user_group=:filtered_dn_attribute:memberOf``
#
# ``:query:`` performs a query for groups. The "name"
# property will be taken as defined by omero.ldap.group_mapping
# and the resulting filter will be AND'ed with the value
# group_filter (above) e.g.
# ``omero.ldap.new_user_group=:query:(member=@{dn})``
#
# ``:bean:`` looks in the server's context for a
# bean with the given name which implements
# ``ome.security.auth.NewUserGroupBean`` e.g.
# ``omero.ldap.new_user_group=:bean:myNewUserGroupMapperBean``
#
omero.ldap.new_user_group=default

# A query element to check if user who is being created
# via the new_user_group setting should be made a
# "manager", i.e. owner, of the queried group. E.g.
# ``omero.ldap.new_user_group_owner=(owner=@{dn})``
# will use the 'manager' attribute to set the 'owner'
# flag in the database. This query element is appened
# to any query used by new_user_group with an AND.
#
# This property is not used by new_user_group type
# 'default' and only potentially by ``:bean:``.

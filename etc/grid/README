  OMERO.grid Application Descriptions
  -----------------------------------

  This directory contains application descriptions for OMERO.grid.
  These define what applications are started on what hosts within
  your network, and so are key to securing your infrastructure.

  All examples assume that processes will be run from the OMERO_HOME
  directory. This simplifies deployment, but is less secure since
  this directory may not belong to you. To further secure your installation,
  make all path references absolute.

  See http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/ome/wiki/OmeroGrid for
  more information.

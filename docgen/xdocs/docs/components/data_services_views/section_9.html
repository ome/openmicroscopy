<p>The <code>BatchCallTree</code> relies on the container's command processor (obtained 
  from the registry) and on the <code>BatchCallMonitor</code>. Both dependencies could 
  be problematic when testing the views package. In fact, the command processor typically 
  executes commands in separate threads and the <code>BatchCallMonitor</code> relays 
  execution events within the Swing event dispatching thread. However, during testing 
  it's usually desirable to keep all invocations within the same thread. For this 
  reason, protected methods are exposed that can be used to remove those dependencies.</p>
<p>This is detailed by the following diagram.</p>

<p>Relying on this just described testing set-up also eases the task of testing the 
  calls package, but a little more work is usually required for that. In fact, concrete 
  <code>BatchCallTree</code> classes in the calls package use the parent's registry 
  to access the data services, which depend on external resources &#151; OMEDS and OMEIS. 
  However, the implementations of those services can easily be replaced with mocks 
  when the container is started in test mode.</p>

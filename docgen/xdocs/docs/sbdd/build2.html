  <title>Build Targets</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The targets available to the build tool can be grouped into the following categories: 
  application, test, documentation, distribution, and shortcuts. All targets output 
  under the <i>Shoola/OUT</i> directory. (<i>Shoola</i> is the directory 
  where you downloaded the CVS tree.) Unless otherwise specified, all directory pathnames 
  in the following description are given relative to the <i>Shoola/OUT</i> directory.</p>
<h5><i>Application Targets</i></h5>
<p>Use the targets in this category to compile and run the application. These targets 
  output under the <i>app</i> directory. Follows their description:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>compile</code>: Compiles all the application sources and links all the 
    application resources. This target processes the source files that are not up-to-date 
    with respect to the corresponding compiled files. So every subsequent invocation 
    of this target will only compile the source files that have changed since the 
    last invocation. The same policy applies to resource files.</li>
  <li><code>run</code>: Runs the application. This target will automatically execute 
    <code>compile</code>, so you won't have to invoke it yourself before running the 
    application.</li>
  <li><code>app.clean</code>: Deletes the <i>app</i> directory and all its contents.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h5><i>Test Targets</i></h5>
<p>Use the targets in this category to test the application and generate test reports. 
  These targets output under the <i>test</i> directory. Follows their description:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>test</code>: Runs all the tests, outputting a brief report for each test 
    on the console and a detailed report under <i>test/reports/html</i>. This target 
    will automatically execute <code>compile</code>, so you won't have to invoke it 
    yourself before running the tests.</li>
  <li><code>test.clean</code>: Deletes the <i>test</i> directory and all its 
    contents.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h5><i>Documentation Targets</i></h5>
<p>Use the targets in this category to generate the project documentation. These targets 
  output under the <i>docs</i> directory. Follows their description:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>docs</code>: Outputs all available project documentation. This includes 
    both technical documents (like this document, architecture/design documents, JavaDoc, 
    etc.) and users documentation.</li>
  <li><code>docs.clean</code>: Deletes the <i>docs</i> directory and all its 
    contents.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h5><i>Distribution Targets</i></h5>
<p>Use the targets in this category to create the deliverables. These targets output 
  under the <i>dist</i> directory. Follows their description:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>dist</code>: Creates the default distribution bundle. This is a zip file 
    whose name indicates the version number. It contains, besides the application 
    file itself, the configuration files, all the required libraries, various launch 
    scripts for the supported platforms, install instructions, and the license file. 
    This target will first clean the application and test directories and then perform 
    a fresh <code>compile</code>-and-<code>test</code> before packaging to make sure 
    the application is good for delivery. The application <i>jar</i> file (<i>shoola.jar</i>) 
    produced during this process is left under the <i>dist</i> directory.</li>
  <li><code>dist-osx</code>: Creates the Mac OS X distribution bundle. This is a zip 
    file whose name indicates the version number and ends with <code>-OSX</code>. 
    It contains, besides the application file itself, the configuration files, all 
    the required libraries, Mac OS X application stubs, install instructions, and 
    the license file. This target will first clean the application and test directories 
    and then perform a fresh <code>compile</code>-and-<code>test</code> before packaging 
    to make sure the application is good for delivery. The application <i>jar</i> 
    file (<i>shoola.jar</i>) produced during this process is left under the 
    <i>dist</i> directory.</li>
  <li><code>dist-docs</code>: Creates the documentation bundle. This target first 
    generates all of the project documentation by invoking <code>docs</code>. It then 
    zips everything in a single file whose name indicates the version number and ends 
    with <code>-doc</code>.</li>
  <li><code>dist.clean</code>: Deletes the <i>dist</i> directory and all its 
    contents.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h5><i>Shortcuts</i></h5>
<p>The targets in this category provide shortcuts to other targets. Follows their 
  description:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>clean</code>: Removes all the output generated by the last build.</li>
  <li><code>all</code>: An alias for <code>clean,dist</code>.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="noteLabel">Note for developers</div>
  <div class="noteContent">Some internal targets not mentioned above could be useful 
    during development. For example, you can run only some given tests or generate 
    only a subset of the project documentation. Also, it is possible to easily tweak 
    existing targets by simply overriding their properties from the command line. 
    Refer to the various child build files for details. Finally note that if you need 
    to experiment with new libraries, just drop them into the <i>LIB</i> or <i>LIB/test</i> 
    directory (depending on whether the application or test code depends on that library) 
    and the build system will pick them up automatically.</div>

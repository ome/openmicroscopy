  <title>Building with Ant</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The build system is completely Ant-based. The build tool that we've been describing 
  has got nothing to do with the actual build files, which are Ant build files. It's 
  just a convenience tool that does all of the Ant's configuration for you. In fact, 
  the various build files invoke optional tasks (please refer to the Ant manual for 
  an explanation of optional tasks) which require additional libraries that don't 
  ship with Ant. Because there might be times when you want to run a build directly 
  with Ant, we now explain how to do it.</p>
<p>First off, you will need Ant 1.6 or later on your machine. (You can download the 
  binary distribution from <a href="http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi">http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi</a>.) 
  Then all the following libraries:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The JUnit Testing Framework (<a href="http://www.junit.org/">http://www.junit.org/</a>). 
    Version: 3.8.1.</li>
  <li>The Xalan-J XSLT library from Apache (<a href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/">http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/</a>). 
    Version: 2_6_0.</li>
  <li>The Jar Bunlder utility to make Mac OS X application bundles (<a href="http://www.loomcom.com/jarbundler/">http://www.loomcom.com/jarbundler/</a>). 
    Version: 1.4. </li>
  <li>The Bean Scripting Framework from Jakarta (<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bsf/">http://jakarta.apache.org/bsf/</a>). 
    Version: 2.3.0-rc1.</li>
  <li>The Rhino JavaScript engine from Mozilla (<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/">http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/</a>). 
    Version: 1_5R3.</li>
  <li>The Formatting Objects Processor (FOP) from the Apache XML Project (<a href="http://xml.apache.org/fop/">http://xml.apache.org/fop/</a>). 
    Version: 0.20.5.</li>
  <li>The Apache Avalon Framework, bundled with the FOP distribution. Version: unknown.</li>
  <li>The Apache Batik SVG Toolkit, bundled with the FOP distribution. Version: unknown.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>All these libraries can be found in the <i>build/tools</i> directory. It's important 
  that you use exactly the distribution versions listed above. In fact, some later 
  versions may be incompatible with each other &#151; for example, BSF 2.3.0-rc1 (the 
  latest version at the time of writing) won't work with Rhino versions greater than 
  1_5 and you might experience similar problems with FOP/Batik.</p>
<p>The next step is to make these libraries available to Ant. There are several ways 
  to link libraries to the Ant's runtime, ranging from the <code>-lib</code> switch 
  on the Ant's command line to placing the jars under <i>{ANT_HOME}/lib</i> or, even 
  better, under <i>{YOUR_HOME}/.ant/lib</i>. Please refer to the Ant manual for details. 
  Finally, you should tweak the runtime properties of each library where required. 
  The documentation released with each library distribution usually contains a section 
  devoted to how to link the library to the Ant's runtime. Please read those documents 
  carefully.</p>
<p>At this point you should be set. Move to the <i>build</i> directory and type <code>ant</code> 
  at your shell prompt. This will give you the list of available targets, which have 
  already been described in a previous <a href="build2.html">section</a>.</p>

  <div class="noteLabel">Important</div>
  <div class="noteContent">if you bypass the build tool, then you're completely responsible 
    for Ant's configuration. In particular when new tasks will be added (and new libraries 
    brought in), you may have to reconfigure Ant. The <i>build/lib.xml</i> header 
    always contains the most up-to-date list of required libraries.</div>

<p>The build tool is a convenience tool that we povide to run any of the available 
  build targets. This tool operates from the command line, so you'll need to be a 
  little familiar with your operating system shell in order to use it. Move to the 
  <i>build</i> directory and from there type, at the command prompt:</p>
<pre class="code">    java -jar build -p</pre>
<p>This will output a list of all available targets along with a short description 
  of what each target does. For a more detailed description simply type:</p>
<pre class="code">    java -jar build</pre>
<p>To run a target, just specify the name of the target after <code>build</code> 
  on the command line. For example:</p>
<pre class="code">    java -jar build compile</pre>
<p>would compile the application sources. If you're an experienced Java developer, 
  you might have already guessed that we're using <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> 
  under the hood. In fact, the build tool simply forwards to Ant whatever follows 
  <code>build</code> on the command line. So, in general, you can use the build 
  tool as follows:</p>
<pre class="code">    java -jar build [options] [target [target2 [target3] ...]]</pre>
<p>where <code>options</code> are any of the Ant options. For example:</p>
<pre class="code">    java -jar build -e compile</pre>
<p>would output logging information on the console without adornments. (You can get 
  the whole list of Ant options by using the <code>-h</code> switch.)</p>

    The build tool is just a convenience to save you the hassle 
    of configuring Ant manually. If you prefer to use Ant directly, 
	there's some tweaking required first. This is described in a 
	later <a href="build3.html">section</a>.</div>

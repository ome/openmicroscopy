This document describes how to build and deploy the Shoola client software.
Shoola is part of the <a href="http://www.openmicroscopy.org/">Open Microscopy
Environment</a> (OME) system and is a client that focuses on delivering a 
software for the visualization and manipulation of both image data and metadata
maintained at an OME server site.</p>
<p>
All the information that is essential to the build and deployment process is
unfolded: how to build and verify the various deliverables, library 
dependencies, how to install and run the software, and the system requirements.
In addition to that, we collected some other useful information related to the
build process such as a description of the project repository and the design of
the build system.</p>

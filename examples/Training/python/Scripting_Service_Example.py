# This is a 'bare-bones' template to allow easy conversion from a simple client-side Python script

# To use the script, simply paste the body of the script (not the connection code)
# into the point indicated below.
# A more complete template, for 'real-world' scripts, is also included in this folder
# This script takes an Image ID as a parameter from the scripting service.
